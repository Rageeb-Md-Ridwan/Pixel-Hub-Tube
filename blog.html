          <h1 class="text-xl"><b>Var:</b></h1>
          <p>
            <b>Function-scoped:</b> Variables declared with var are
            function-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the function in
            which they are declared.<br /><b>Hoisting:</b> var declarations are
            hoisted to the top of their function or global context, which means
            you can access the variable before it's declared, but it will have
            an initial value of undefined.
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-xl"><b>Let:</b></h1>
          <p>
            <b>Block-scoped:</b> Variables declared with let are block-scoped,
            meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by curly
            braces) in which they are defined.<br /><b>No hoisting:</b> let
            declarations are not hoisted to the top of the block; they are only
            accessible after the point of declaration.
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-xl"><b>Const:</b></h1>
          <p>
            <b>Block-scoped:</b> Like let, const is block-scoped.<br /><b
              >Constant value:</b
            >
            Variables declared with const must be assigned a value at the time
            of declaration and cannot be reassigned. The value remains constant
            throughout the block scope.

              >Used for assignments:</b
            >
            Developers may explicitly set a variable to null to indicate that it
            has no meaningful value.<br /><b>Comparison:</b> null can be used to
            check if a variable has been intentionally set to represent no
            value.

          <p>
            REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural
            style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless
            communication between client and server, where communication is made
            through standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). RESTful APIs
            use standardized, resource-based URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
            to perform operations on resources (data entities), and data is
            often exchanged in lightweight formats like JSON. REST is known for
            its simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration, making it a
            widely adopted choice for building web services.
